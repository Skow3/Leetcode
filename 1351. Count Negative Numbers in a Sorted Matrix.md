# EASY 
1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

Now here see what i learnt :
My first approach [I Didn't saw that they are in Non-increasing order]:

# Solution 1 :
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countNegatives(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i =0; i< grid.size() ; i++){
            for(int j=0; j<grid[0].size();j++){
                if(grid[i][j]<0){
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```


Now When i saw that the condition of O(n+m) but ... I read that only rows are in Non-increasing order:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def countNegatives(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        ans=0
        n= len(grid[0])
        for i in grid:
            for j in range(n):
                if i[j]<0:
                    ans+= n-j
                    break
        return ans
```

This was still O(m*n) in some worst cases.


SO NOW I READ WHAT EXACTLY THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT I.E NON-INCREASING ORDER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS :
```python
def countNegatives(self, grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    row, col = m - 1, 0
    ans = 0

    while row >= 0 and col < n:
        if grid[row][col] < 0:
            ans += n - col
            row -= 1
        else:
            col += 1

    return ans
```
