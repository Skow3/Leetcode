Had an easy peasy approach because i did it with python, Python's type conversion abilities are so good sometimes.

# Final Approach
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maximum69Number (self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        stnum = str(num)
        for i in range(len(stnum)):
            if stnum[i] == '6':
                print(stnum[:i]+ '9' +stnum[i+1:])
                break
```
